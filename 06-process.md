+ **Effective Use of Colors in a Visualization**

	When coming up with a visualization one must understand the impact of colors used in a chart. Color can grab people's attention, set the mood, and influence perception.  Our brain views color in terms of lightness (black to white), saturation (dull to bright), and hue (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple.)

	To start with here are some Dos and Donts:

	**Dos :**

	+ **Use one color to represent continuous data**  – Representing continuous data and ranges by varying the saturation or value of a color makes you chart straightforward and easy to read.

	+ **Use contrasting colors for comparisons**  – Contrasting colors help the viewer differentiate the data quickly
	+ **Use colors that appear in nature**  – People respond better to colors they are familiar with; colors that appear naturally in the world around them.

	+ **Use branded colors for marketing materials or presentations**  – Customizing your data visualizations to match your company&#39;s color scheme helps you align with your brand and keeps your messaging consistent. It also helps with brand recognition.

	+ **Use color to highlight your most important information**  – Color can be a great way to guide the viewer&#39;s eye to key points on your chart. We suggest using muted colors with one bright color to bring attention to your most important information.

	**Donts:**

	+ **Pick colors that are too hard to distinguish**  – It&#39;s important for your viewer to be able to understand the data you are presenting. If they need to quickly make comparisons, the colors need to be easy to distinguish.

	+ **Use too many colors**  – Try to avoid the rainbow effect! Less is more. Make sure the colors you choose have a purpose and make your chart easier to read, not harder.

	Some Prerequisites while choosing a color scheme for a visualization are:

	+ **Symbolism :** Symbolic colors vary by culture: for example, red is often used to represent love or passion in Western cultures, whilst Eastern cultures associate it with wealth and fortune.
	+ **Emotional values :** for example, think of age: little ones generally appreciate brighter colors, and therefore retailers whose target audience consist of children will use cheery and vivid colors on packaging and advertisements.
	+ **Historical experiences :** for example, if you once felt threatened by a fire, red and orange might have negative connotations for you throughout your life.
	+ **Signaling conventions in society :** Signal colors are hues that send our minds a message. They are part of our everyday life, just take for example how we use traffic lights to regulate our drives.
